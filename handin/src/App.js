            <h2>What is Iterative Design?</h2>
            <p>
              Iterative design is the process of designing a prototype from start to finish, including critique and iteration based on feedback. 
              As a team, Brandon Wu, Will Park, Kenneth Liou, and Kaitlyn Williams 
              went through the iterative design process to redesign the homepage of our 
              client. 
              
              The client we worked with is <a href="https://www.partiful.com">Partiful!</a>
              


              {/* Explain More */}

            <p>Partiful is a new events platform and party RSVP website. It offers tools to create, customize, and share event invitations, allowing hosts to manage RSVPS, track guest lists, and communicate with attendees without having to keep someone's number. With a user-friendly interface, Partiful aims to make organizing parties and events more straightforward and enjoyable.</p>
            <p>
              We were very excited to work with Partiful considering that every member
              of our group has used the interface to invite people to events. Having 
              some experience with this program allowed us to explore some creative
              ideas we had to improve one of our favorite party invitation platforms.

          <h2>Process Overview</h2>
          <p>
              Our iterative design process for this client can be outlined by the following steps: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Reading the brief from the client
                </li>
                <li>
                  Asking clarifying questions to identify the core problems 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Individually creating sketches of low-fidelity wireframes
                </li>
                <li>
                  Collaborating to settle on a design for our first round of low-fidelity wireframes
                </li>
                <li>
                  Receiving feedback from our peers
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sending the wireframes to our client, Partiful, to receive their feedback
                </li>
                <li>
                  Redesigning our low-fidelity wireframes as an intermediate step before creating the high-fidelity wireframes
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creating the high-fidelity interactive wireframe based off of the feedback we received from our client
                </li>
                <li>
                  Meeting with our client, Partiful, to show our final high-fidelity interactive wireframe and receiving feedback
                </li>
              </ul>

            <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
            <p>
              The clients at Partiful tasked us with redesigning their homepage for a more intuitive design to attract more users and improve navigation.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Some problems that they had expressed included the following: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                Inability to see more than one or two events on the homepage at a time (limited surface area of h-scroll)
                </li>
                <li>
                The difficulty of using h-scroll for every element on their homepage
                </li>
                <li>
                The lack of content on the homepage other than events to bring 
                users to the app even when they do not have any upcoming events
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keeping elements playful 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Once we established the main painpoints of Partiful's homepage in the 
              eyes of its designers, we individually created sketches of the low-fidelity
              wireframe for the homepage, as seen below. Use the arrows at the 
              bottom of the Figma display to scroll through some of our 
              different sketches.

            <p>
              We got some of our main inspiration from Netflix in its categorial
              h-scroll with the ability to vertical scroll through different 
              categories. Additionally, we thought of adding some kind of social 
              aspect, similar to stories on Instagram or Snapchat, where users 
              can post pictures from events. We also had the idea of a card carousel 
              to display events. Finally, we thought about using a gumball style circle that increases in size accroding to the number of people attending the event, containing the profiles of the users attending.

              To get feedback on our design, we created a Loom video to explain our understanding of the problem, walkthrough of our design choices and though process, and next steps/questions. The video was shared with the Partiful team for review as well as fellow peers for feedback.

              Some feedback we received from our peers included adding more interactions 
              to demonstrate the flow between tabs, as well as creating a script 
              for our Loom video to better describe our design to our client. 

              Some feedback we received from our client was to make the information 
              heirarchy much more clear, making the events page the main page 
              on the homepage. Additionally, they loved the gumball idea, thinking
              that it was very fun. They wanted to hear more about what is on the 
              "Trends" page and how that content was generated (through users or 
              companies or both). Finally, they challenged us to think more 
              outside the box in displaying events and to think of something that 
              displays more events at a time than a card carousel.

                to display multiple events on a single page. We also kept the

              In this prototype, we implemented an Apple Wallet display of events,
              where the events are stacked on top of each other. For incoming events,
              the user can swipe left/right to show if they are attending or not. 
              Additionally, the user can scroll vertically to see upcoming events
              and past events. They are able to click on "Trends" to navigate
              to the "Trends" page where they will find party themes, resturants/food,
              and venues. They can click on the "Friends" page to navigate to 
              users' highlights where a user can click on the highlight and see
              a polariod picture post from the party. They can return to the "Friends"
              page to see their friends and suggested users.

            <h2>Founder Feedback</h2>
            <p>
              After completing our Hi-Fi design, we sent a Loom video of our design and got to meet with the product designers of Partiful as well to show what we produced based on the feedback and multiple iterations that we thought of. 
              The following Loom is a synopsis of the information we provided to the designers during our meeting with them.
        
              <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', padding: '10px' }}>
                <iframe

                />
              </div>

              The feedback we received from the Partiful team was very positive. They liked the design we created and thought it was a significant improvement over their current homepage. They also provided us with some suggestions for further improvement, which we will incorporate into our final design.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Here are some of the key points from the feedback we received:
              <ul>
                <li>They liked the Apple Wallet style of viewing the events.</li>
                <li>All of the points of feedback and criteria to hit were answered in the Hi-Fi.</li>
                <li>Interactions should be generalized where a swiping motion should signify only one of reorganization or stating "Going"</li>
                <li>The Apple Wallet should also have an interaction to open up to see all the events at once instead of it being stacked which will help accesibility.</li>
                <li>In the trends tab, the content should be geared more towards getting inspiration to help hosts.</li>
                <li>In the friends tab, more of an activity page seeing people going to parties isntead of just seeing what people there are</li>
                <li>They loved the polaroid picture UI in the friends tab as well as the highlights section.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>All the feedback was really helpful in identifying which direction to take the design and help thorough out the next steps in making this a fully thought out design.</p>

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
              Redesigning the Partiful homepage was a challenging yet rewarding experience. We learned the importance of iterative design and how it can help us create a better product. We also learned how to work with a client and incorporate their feedback into our designs. Overall, we are proud of the final design we created and hope that it will help Partiful attract more users and improve their platform.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Some things we could consider if we continued to process in the future would 
              be creating the "Trends" page to be more geared towards helping hosts plan 
              events. This could look like creating some kind of Tinder-like 
              swiping feature for users to swipe through and "like" themes, food options, and 
              venues for events. 
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              We want to give <b>many thanks</b> to the Partiful team for giving us the opportunity to work with them and for providing us with valuable feedback throughout the design process.
